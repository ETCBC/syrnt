Syriac New Testament
==============================

This repo is a research environment for the study of the Syriac New Testament.
You can run your own programs off-line, and publish your work in online notebooks.
To that end, the plain text of the Peshitta has brought into the Text-Fabric format,
which lends itself for easy data processing.

Corpus
------

The Syriac New Testament is considered part of the Peshitta.
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshitta#New_Testament_Peshitta).

However, we treat the Syriac New Testament and the (Old Testament) Peshitta as two different corpora.
