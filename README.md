Syriac New Testament
====================

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/153414018.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1464787)

The Syriac New Testament is considered part of the Peshitta.
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshitta#New_Testament_Peshitta).

However, we treat the Syriac New Testament and the (Old Testament) Peshitta as two different corpora.

SyrNT in Text-Fabric
--------------------------------------

This repo is a research environment for the study of the Syriac New Testament.
You can run your own programs off-line, and publish your work in online notebooks.
To that end, the plain text of the Peshitta has brought into the Text-Fabric format,
which lends itself for easy data processing.

Corpus
------

The source data in this repo is a
[SEDRA](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/about/sedra) database export
made by George A. Kiraz and James W. Bennett.

See also [about](docs/about.md).

Software
--------

The main processing tool is [Text-Fabric](docs/textfabric.md). It is instrumental to
turn the analysis of ancient data into computing narratives.

The ecosystem is Python and Jupyter notebooks.
