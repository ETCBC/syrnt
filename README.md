# Syriac

The Syriac New Testament is considered part of the Peshitta.
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshitta#New_Testament_Peshitta).

However, we treat the Syriac New Testament and the (Old Testament) Peshitta as two different corpora.

# SyrNT in Text-Fabric

This repo is a research environment for the study of the Syriac New Testament.
You can run your own programs off-line, and publish your work in online notebooks.
To that end, the plain text of the Peshitta has brought into the Text-Fabric format,
which lends itself for easy data processing.

# Corpus

The source data in this repo is a
[SEDRA](https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/about/sedra) database export
made by George A. Kiraz and James W. Bennett.

See also [about](docs/about.md).

# Software

The main processing tool is [Text-Fabric](docs/textfabric.md). It is instrumental to
turn the analysis of ancient data into computing narratives.

The ecosystem is Python and Jupyter notebooks.

# Getting started
